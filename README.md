## Reuseable_pipeline

This is a rebuild of the pipeline I created for the first open source project on road safety during the hamoye internship ([Click Here](https://github.com/kene111/07-road-safety)). The pipeline created made use of light weight components, 
this type of component is majorly used for fast and easy deployment ( of machine learning models). The set back with light weight components is, the components can't be used in other pipelines even if the component can be used to complete the workflow. 
In this rebuild, I made use of reuseable components, which means that if seen fit, a component in the pipeline can be used in another project pipelines or more... Check the end of this readme for links to more information.
