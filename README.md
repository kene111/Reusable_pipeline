## Reuseable_pipeline

This is a rebuild of the pipeline I created for the first open source project on road safety under the hamoye internship ([Click Here](https://github.com/kene111/07-road-safety)). The pipeline created made use of light weight components, 
these type component is majorly used for fast and easy deployment ( of machine learning model). The set back with light weight components are they aren't reusable in other projects. 
In this rebuild, I made use of reuseable components, which means that if seen fit, a component in the pipeline can be used in another project can be used on other pipelines and many
more... Check the end of this readme for links to more informtion.
