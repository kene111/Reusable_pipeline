## Reuseable_pipeline

This is a rebuild of the pipeline I created for the first open source project on road safety under the hamoye internship. The pipeline created made use of light weight components, 
these type component is majorly used for fast and easy deployment ( of machine learning model). The set back with light weight components are they aren't reusable in other projects. 
In this rebuild, I made use of reuseable components, which means that if seen fit, a component in the pipeline can be used in another project can be used on other pipelines and many
more... Check the end of this readme for links to more informtion.
